# Neural Networks From Scratch

This repo contains the code used on the youtube video. The main objective is to showcase how one can write the code for a neural network without libraries such as Keras/Tensorflow or PyTorch, relying almost only on matrix multiplication to achieve a sequential neural network of fully connected layers.
