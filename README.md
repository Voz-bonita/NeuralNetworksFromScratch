# Neural Networks From Scratch

This repo contains the code used in the youtube video [https://youtu.be/yJdgNJdWtFI](https://youtu.be/yJdgNJdWtFI). The main objective is to showcase a visual explanation on the math and code for a deep feedforward neural network without libraries such as Keras/Tensorflow or PyTorch, relying almost entirely on matrix multiplications to achieve a sequential neural network of fully connected layers.
